 This init method cannot change the `tosShownAndAccepted` parameter. Use

 These two init methods exist to avoid the (slightly awkward) NSNumber box that would
 be needed around `tosShownAndAccepted` if it was optional/nullable, and to enforce
 that it is either nil or YES. This also forces the business type to "individual"
